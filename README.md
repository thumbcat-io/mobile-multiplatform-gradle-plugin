# Mobile multiplatform gradle plugin

This Gradle plugin simplifies the setup of mobile Kotlin multiplatform Gradle modules.  

This project is a clone and planned divergence from [the work done by IceRock MAG Inc.](https://github.com/icerockdev/mobile-multiplatform-gradle-plugin) and is intended for Thumbcat project use only. Please use and contribute to their wonderful plugin instead.
